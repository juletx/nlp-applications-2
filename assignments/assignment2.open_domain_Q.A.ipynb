We present the management of a patient with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. Case A 66-years-old man presented to the hospital and his recent travel history, infective symptoms and CXR made him a possible COVID-19 suspect. Emergency surgery was decided considering the septic condition. The patient was transported to operating theatre with supplemental oxygen over a face mask and plastic covering over the trolley. Rapid sequence intubation was performed by an experienced anesthetist using a videolaryngoscope. After surgery, the patient remained intubated to avoid re-intubation due to initial presentation of respiratory distress. Droplet, contact and airborne infection precautions were instituted. Conclusions Our objective was to facilitate surgical management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 while minimising risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.\n","\n","The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 26, 2020. .\n","\n","The study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the Second Affiliated All rights reserved.

Create an index for the paper retrieval system\n","\n","The system that we are going to develop in our approach is the information retrieval system.

A field is a piece of information for each document in the index, for example, id, path of the document, title and text.

The most recent comparable episode is the Spanish flu of 1918 (Trilla et al., 2008) , so pandemics are likely to occur at most once during one's lifetime. Nevertheless, individuals need to make everyday decisions such as how to manage inventories of staples, how much to consume and save, when to buy or sell stocks, etc., and these decisions depend on the expectation of how long and severe the epidemic is. Governments must also make decisions such as to what extent imposing travel restrictions, social distancing, closure of schools and businesses, etc., and for how long (Anderson et al., 2020) .\\n\",\n","  '2.
