It is notable here that, in COVID-19 patients, decreased arterial oxygen saturation has been reported prior to the dyspnoea and dramatically decreased saturation which leads to hospitalization and PaO2/FiO2 can fluctuate during the course of clinical COVID-19 progression and so, as in the clinical setting, serial close monitoring of oxygen saturation is ideal (Cascella et al., 2020) .

AT1R antagonists may enhance the expression of ACE2 in humans (although scattered evidence exists regarding the lungs), but there is a significant baseline amount of ACE2 that can bind and internalize the virus. Also, the role of angiotensin II, as a new vasopressor in the management of shock following COVID-19 and protector against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with or without shock, is unknown and must be studied at this time of international crisis.\n","\n","Disruptions to TB services can act at all stages of the TB care cascade. During a lockdown, movement restrictions would curtail opportunities for those experiencing TB symptoms to seek care. Even once these people are able to visit a provider or health facility, the diagnostic and laboratory capacity needed to support TB diagnosis may be severely reduced -for example, with molecular diagnostic tools for TB being repurposed for COVID-19 17 or TB laboratory staff being redirected to Covid-19 efforts. National TB programmes are investing significant effort to continue supporting those already on TB treatment, but there are also concerns that lockdown conditions may interfere with the continued supply of drugs 18 . To capture this range of possible disruptions, we performed a rapid consultation amongst experts at the Stop TB Partnership and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Table 1 lists those experts' consensus opinion as to the degree to which TB services could be disrupted by COVID-related lockdowns, at each step of the care cascade. There is substantial uncertainty around these possible impacts, and as described below, we performed sensitivity analysis to identify which components of disruptions would have the greatest impact on overall TB burden.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tJsKd12X12Xt"},"source":["### 3.

Nevertheless, individuals need to make everyday decisions such as how to manage inventories of staples, how much to consume and save, when to buy or sell stocks, etc., and these decisions depend on the expectation of how long and severe the epidemic is. Governments must also make decisions such as to what extent imposing travel restrictions, social distancing, closure of schools and businesses, etc., and for how long (Anderson et al., 2020) .\\n\",\n","  '2.
