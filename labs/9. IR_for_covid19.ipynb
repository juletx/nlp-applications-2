Studies show that SARS-CoV-2 stays for more than 9 days and be resistant, like other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), can live on inanimate surfaces such as metals, glass, and plastic at room temperature. Also, at ambient temperatures of 30 °C and above, the duration of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced (Kampf et al. 2020) . Some studies have suggested that a temperature of 56 OC for 90 min or a temperature of 67 OC for 60 min can cause SARS-CoV-2 to be inactive (Henwood 2020) . Kampf et al. (2020) showed that at room temperature and 50% humidity, the resistance of the virus was more than 30%. In one study, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces confirmed that the virus was more resistant to smooth surfaces than others. According to the results of this study, the virus remains stable at temperatures of 22 oC and relative humidity of 65% for 4 days on surfaces such as glass and banknotes and 7 days on smooth surfaces such as steel and plastic. It also stays on rough surfaces such as fabric and wood for up to 2 days (Chin et al. 2020) . Another investigation, which examined environmental levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hospital centers, found that the most important environmental levels of infection were self-service printers (20%) (used in Chinese laboratories), desktops, and keyboards (16.8%), door handles (16%), telephones (12.5%), and medical equipment (12.5%) (Ye et al. 2020) . Studies show that students touch their face with their hands an average of 23 times an hour. 56% of it is the touch of the skin, 36% is the lips, 31% is the nose, and 31% is the eyes (Kwok et al. 2015) . Although SARS-CoV-2 is not available on the surface of complete information on viral load, it can be said that by reducing the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces, the amount of virus load on surfaces can be reduced (Kampf et al. 2020) . The WHO has recommended that cleanliness be done with water and detergents to ensure environmental cleanliness, and then the use of common environmental disinfectants, such as sodium hypochlorite (WHO 2020c). The most well-known methods of surface disinfection to remove SARS-CoV-2 virus are, in short, the use of ethyl alcohol (62-70%), or hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) or sodium hypochlorite (0.1%, dilution ratio 1 to 50) with a contact time of 1 min (Henwood 2020; WHO 2014) . \\n',\n","  'In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by highly infectious virus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China. 1 Subsequently, and due to the highly infectious nature of the virus, the disease became a pandemic in a relatively short period of time with over 1.6 million cases and 97 000 deaths worldwide (as of 10 April 2020).

As protective immunity does not exist in humans and the virus is capable of escaping innate immune responses, it can proliferate, unhindered, in primarily infected tissues. Subsequent cell death results in the release of virus particles and intracellular components to the extracellular space, which result in immune cell recruitment, the generation of immune complexes and associated damage. Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome. Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled. Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents.\\n',\n","  'Different companies have already taken initiatives to develop a vaccine against COVID-19. It is important to note that the studies on SARS have provided important clues for vaccine against COVID-19 and has also fasttracked the overall process of vaccine development. The vaccine initiatives by various companies against COVID-19 is broadly based on three strategies: (i) using DNA or RNA, (ii) weakened virus known as VLPs, and (iii) targeting viral proteins such as S protein (WHO 2020b). One of the important factors for an antigen to be considered as a vaccine candidate is its ability to mount a good immune response. However, in practicality one is always constrained in terms of the antigen that can be used as vaccine candidates. Thus, to enhance immune responses, Kim et al. developed a microneedle delivery method that induces an antigenspecific antibody response as early as week 2 after immunization. Microneedle injection causes brief mechanical stress that induces the local innate immune response and thus avoids the use of adjuvant. Also, the skin possesses a high amount of immune cells involved in innate immune response, so even injecting a small amount of antigen can lead to significant activation of innate immune responses against the antigen (Kim et al. 2020) , making it an effective strategy when antigens are not too immunogenic.\\n',\n","  'The outcome of any infectious disease depends on its yin-yang relationship with the immune system. A hyperactive immune system can be as dangerous as a virulent virus.
