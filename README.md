# NLP Applications II: Information Extraction, Question Answering and Conversational Systems

## Plan

- Course on most relevant tasks for building NLP applications.
- Allow to understand
    - When and how to apply NLP techniques in real-world scenario.
    - Not only the use pre-existing NLP libraries,
    - But be able to reimplement and adapt own models.
- Provide leads to explore and learn further
    - Master projects ideas welcome!
    - Open for collaborations [hitz.eus](http://hitz.eus/) and [ixa.eus](http://www.ixa.eus/)
- Regular sessions: 13 sessions of 150 minutes
    - Each session mixes theoretical and hands-on laboratories 
- Extra session for the presentations!
- Material available in egela and google-drive
    - <http://ixa2.si.ehu.eus/~jibloleo/nlpapp2> 
- Course is divided in three main parts: 
    - Information Extraction systems (Oier Lopez de Lacalle) 6 sessions in total
    - Question Answering systems (Ander Barrena) 4 sessions in total
    - Recommender System and Conversational systems (Mikel Larrañaga) 3 sessions in total

## Labs, assignments and project

- **Laboratories** are focused to put the theory in practice (no submission). 
- You need to complete and submit **3 assignments**.
    - **Assignment 1**. IE: Intent-classification and Slot-filling 
    - **Assignment 2**. QA: QA+IR in open domain 
    - **Assignment 3**. CS: Recommender system
    - **Deadline** **for the assignments:** **1st of June** 
- **Main Project**: on any open topic related to NLP application.
    - Do the implementation, write-up a technical report (~6 pages), present in class. 
    - **Presentations: 1st of June** (to be confirmed)
    - **Deadline for the final report: 8th of June** (to be confirmed)

## Labs and prerequisites

- Basic programming experience, university-level course in computer science, experience in Python. Basic math skills (algebra or pre-calculus), but not much!
- Knowledge about machine learning or deep learning is required. 
- Laboratories:
    - Python (scikit-learn, pytorch, tensorflow…) using servers from Google Colaboratory
    - Time might be tight => auto-study / finish labs at home / ask for help to lecturers
    - Time might be plenty => review slides / do assignments

## Evaluation

**Class assignments**: 50% of the grading **Final project:** 50% of the grading

- Each group of student (**2/3 people**) will propose a subject for the final project to one of the lecturers, depending on his/her interests.
- Project proposal are due to May 19 (note that you will have 2 weeks for finishing!).
- The final project will be graded based on the written report, technicality and presentation, with the following percentages:
    - **write-up** 15%, including features like clarity, structure, background, references, discussion
    - **technical** 20%, incl. features like correctness and depth of the work
    - **poster presentation** 15%, including clarity, structure, discussion
